Freelancing profile website
Created from an HTML template, Photon. This is my testbed for learning HTML and tweaking it to exhibit my growing portfolio of communications clients. 
I'm 90% focused on the UX and appearance of the site - once functionality has been achieved! - and only 10% on the code. I need it to be clear enough that a novice can navigate it (yup, that's me!). Comments on how to clean it up and still run smoothly are most welcome.
Thanks for stopping by!
